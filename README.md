Consolidation Challenge: Fake Excuse Notes Generator
Parents must sometimes write notes to excuse their child out of specific school activities. Create a short form that offers pre-defined excuse notes to help Parents get this done faster.

In an "excuse.php" file, create an "apology generator" to make life easier for parents of children in primary school.

You need a form with these questions:

name of the child
Gender of the child (girl or boy)
name of the teacher
a reason for the absence to be chosen among options (radio type input):
illness
death of the pet (or a family member)
significant extra-curricular activity
any other excuse of your choice
For each option, invent an appropriate excuse according to the chosen option (inspiration).

Objective
With the help of a condition, generates the appropriate excuse word based on the answers to the form. The parent will only have to copy and paste the answer to write his or her letter of apology.

BONUS
Provide 5 apologies for each reason and ensure that one of the 5 apologies is randomly selected and included in the letter of apology.

Developmental Criteria
adds the date of the day (format "Day, the dd Month YYYY")
adds the polite phrase.
no spelling mistakes.
Careful UX: make it a real product? (favicon + CSS + responsive + typography + logo)
